# Simple-MNIST-Classifier
Simple MNIST digit classifier using a softmax regressor on Tensorflow.

Materials and Methods:
The MNIST digit classifer was trained using a cross entropy error metric on 10000 epochs.

Data:
Graph of accuracy over epochs visualized using Tensorboard. As the algorithm trains, the accuracy slowly increases.
